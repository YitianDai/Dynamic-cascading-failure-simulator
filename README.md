# Dynamic-cascading-failure-simulator
A dynamic cascading failure simulation platform implemented in DIgSILENT PowerFactory via the Python API. It automatically develops cascading mechanisms, simulates sets of failure scenarios and processes results, and also has good scalability such that it can be easily applied to any power system model.
